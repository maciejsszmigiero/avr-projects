# avr-projects repository

This repository will contain various Atmel AVR projects which share common library code.
The library code was written for ATmega 1284(P) µC, but patches to add support for other AVR µC models are welcome.

Currently, there is only one project in this repository: a Smart UPS addon (in smartupsaddon directory).
See its directory for details.
